# BotBot v2 Open Source

I have decided to make Bot Bot open source BUT, this doesn't mean I'm not finished.

Expect V3 to be better at everything this one couldn't be. 

You might be wondering, where is V1?
V1 was written using nodejs and that bot was just a copy-paste of other open source bots(sorry). This one was written in python but I was just a beginner when I first started.

The code sucks so don't bother using it as a starting point for your discord bot. Just learn from the docs and make sure you know python first cause I don't want yall to make the same mistake.

# HOWEVER
If you do decide to download and use this make sure to replace the empty enviroment variables with your api keys, databases, whatever. Just don't expect this to be updated ever. Thank you
